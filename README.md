Linear Search Algorithms
This repository contains Java implementations of different linear search algorithms:

Linear Search with Index Return (linearSearch method):

Searches for a target integer in an array and returns the index of the first occurrence.
Returns -1 if the target is not found or the array is empty.
Linear Search with Element Return (linearSearch2 method):

Searches for a target integer in an array and returns the exact element if found.
Returns Integer.MAX_VALUE if the target is not found or the array is empty.
Linear Search with Boolean Return (linearSearch3 method):

Searches for a target integer in an array and returns true if the target exists in the array.
Returns false if the target is not found or the array is empty.
